Master's thesis

This code consists of the setup, data extraction and cleaning, model setup, data exploration, model results, and report objects used in my final thesis.

A few important notes:

- The models were fit on Miami's Redhawk Cluster (though a few may exist in this document). This document reads these model objects from these cluster-produced files. 
- Much of the data extraction code originates from the "Best Practices for Using eBird Data" ebook, found here: https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/ebird-best-practices/.
  The eBird team at Cornell deserves great credit for providing this extraordinary compilation of resources. I have since modified the code to suit my needs, but you'll find
  that the core process is of their design. I owe eBird a deep dept of gratitude, and I am thankful to Matthew Strimas-Mackey for corresponding with me as needed regarding 
  questions that I might have.
- The actual paper is produced in another RMarkdown file, but relies on the objects exported from this analysis file.
